 saouw_arc.1.desc:0 "Our scan indicates several giant hollow spaces inside those inaccessible area, however there appear to be no obvious entry. The good news is during the survay we discover a floor close to the top that is easily accessible and also have a staircase leading up, but bad news is the staircase has the top sealed, we have to somehow drill a hole into whatever the place might be."
 saouw_arc.1.a:0 "Let's start digging, what could possibly go wrong."
 saouw_arc.2.name:0 "The sealed staircase"
 saouw_arc.2.desc:0 "Drilling up seems easy at first, but we soon find a problem : whatever the floor, ceiling and wall of this place is made from, is basically unbreakable, it will just repair itself whenever it's damaged. But with enough data gather from its self-repairing process, our digging team managed to disrupt the self-repair process and cut the ceiling open."

 saouw_arc.3.desc:0 "Upon entering the upper floor, our digging team is greeted with a long hallway with what seems to be cryo chambers on each side, but closer inspection revel that they are not cryo chamber and whoever resting inside appears to have been petrified before being put inside. Further inspection reveled that they are in a frozen, suspended state, we believe we have the necessary technology to unfreeze them, but our scientists are hesitat as they believe those personnel are frozen for good measure."

 saouw_arc.4.desc:0 "Climbing further up, our team came across a strange room that until today only exist in fictional works : a giant council with senates seats surrounding all sides, as well as another room filled with all kinds of random stuff. With enough digging around, we managed to find what appears to be several notebooks containing some strange knowledge, from ways to survaliance every single citizen to crazy things like ways to peeking past events. While our research team are busy documenting everything, our digging team just found something unusual -- a small tunnel hiddden behind storage shelfs."
 saouw_arc.4.a:0 "Keep digging."
 saouw_arc.5.name:0 "The untold history"
 saouw_arc.5.desc:0 "Crwling through the small tunnel and up an elevator, we arrived at what appear to be the top floor of the cathedral, curiously the only thing in here is a giant, oversized bed, seemingly out of place, as well as a laptop looking thing sitting on top of a stone pillar, we could only assume this is where the great priest from the old legend used to reside, so naturally we try the method of peeking the past just to see what used to happen here. Long story short, we were all shocked by what presented infront of us, we heard from legends that we are living in a simulation, but to see the proof first hand is another thing. From the creation of the authoritarian regim that no longer exist to its downfall, including events like contacting another dimension, creation of the integrator units, and the final 1 on 1 battle that ends the regim. However these also managed to raise more question than it answered. While we have extracted some information out of the past events, and even managed to dug up some strange things, we can't waste our time try figuring things out as we still have more area to explore."

 saouw_arc.6.name:0 "The Great Library"
 saouw_arc.6.desc:0 "Poking around the former thorn room that is now a mini museum, we managed to located a pathway to a old but still functioning elevator, using the elevator we reach a 20 floor spanning giant library, everything looks like brand new despite the visitor list indicated this place have existed for centries. Diging through mountain of records and books, our research team are finally able to put all the puzzle together and solve the mystry of our world's truth. Apparently whoever is observing outside craeated this world as an experment trying to creating truely sentient AI for military purpose, but things didn't go quite as they planned. However, contrary to public opnion, instead of resetting this world, they somehow decided to turn this world into yet another experiment. Unfortunately records stop at this point and no further info is given, but the amount of information this place contains is enough to flip the world up side down."
 saouw_arc.6.a:0 "Intriguing!"
 saouw_arc.7.name:0 "A......Garden and......who are they again?"
 saouw_arc.7.desc:0 "Leaving the great library and progress further up, we arrived at a strange place as if someone had move an entire small hill here just to serve as their private garden, while the scenery looks relaxing, we are reminded about where we are by a set of three frozen person under a tree. While we want to attempt unfreeze them, our research team remind us the note from the thorn room mentioning not to wake them up, meanwhile the digging team just report back that there are no other strange places needing further inspection, which concluded this expedition."

Hypothetically it should take at least twice the time to have any form of air travel, but thanks to our all-mighty star king and queen, who actually are visitors from another dimension, our technology and society was break-throughed several ages in just a centry, and now we even have faster-than-light travel. Frankly speaking though, these changes are all caused by the great inter-dimension war 200 years ago, we lost several intergrated knights in that war, in exchange we got almost eternal peace; The old hierarchy system were also completely thrown out of window after the war. What follow is a age of technology boom and mass-colonize of lands outside the terminal wall, and the forming of a proto-democracy and its evolution. We have even set foot on and colonize our moon, establish inter-planetary trading and form space forces. But as an old saying goes, nothing is eternal, after 150 years of ruling, star king and queen left this world with a final quote of 'The gate to real world will be open again one day, but what waiting there might not be prosperous unification'. And with almost half centry since their departure, it's our task to carry on their willings and expand into the vast interstellar spaces and build an even greater country."
